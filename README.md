üéÆ Phantom Mod Menu UI - Educational Demo
‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL DISCLAIMER: This is a PURELY EDUCATIONAL DEMONSTRATION of UI design concepts. NOT for actual game modification.

üìñ About This Project
This repository contains a proof-of-concept user interface designed to demonstrate modern Python GUI development techniques, including:

Custom toggle switch components

Overlay window management

Hotkey-driven interfaces

Dark theme design systems

Scrollable compact layouts

This is a FAKE, NON-FUNCTIONAL interface that contains zero game modification code. It serves as an educational resource for developers learning advanced tkinter/Python GUI programming.

üéØ Educational Purpose
This project demonstrates:

Creating borderless, always-on-top windows

Implementing custom UI controls from scratch

Handling global hotkeys in Python

Designing space-efficient, scrollable interfaces

Building draggable window components
